      i will have to signin an account

# HOW I WILL DO IT

- an expo project is need ✅
  - a backend we have firebase for it ✅
- app should have screen and navigation? ✅
- we made a register page

  - we needed inputs ✅
  - now we need user inputs to be saved in states ✅
  - we need user to be doing valid inputs✅
  - after validation we need a user indicator to be shwon that user data is being sent to firebase ✅

    🐞 => user password is being exposed in database all out in open. so we need an authentication soluytion

  - we took password and email to firebase auth and asked it to create an account
  - after being successful of register process we took the uid and saved user details based on that in firestore

  login page?

  -> when user data after auth of registation gets done! he/she should be navigated to login page

# VALIDATION OF FORMS IN REACT NATIVE APPS

- normal state based if else
- formik and yup state validation (💡)
